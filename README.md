# Digital-Admin-Assistant
Search for guidance on administrative inquiries based on the Establishment Code.

# Project Overview
The Digital Admin Assistant is a lightweight, web-based decision-support tool designed to assist administrative officers in the Sri Lankan public service. It serves as a centralized and structured knowledge base of administrative rules and procedures, primarily sourced from the Establishment Code.

This tool's main purpose is to streamline the process of finding relevant regulations for administrative inquiries, helping officers make consistent and informed decisions without having to manually sift through large volumes of text.

# Features
Intelligent Search: Users can type natural language queries (e.g., "unauthorized absence" or "mishandled property") to find relevant administrative guidance.

Structured Data Display: Search results are presented in clear, well-organized cards that include the observation, section reference, and a concise recommendation.

Visual Categorization: Results are color-coded and styled with icons to visually separate different administrative categories like Attendance, Misconduct, and Financial matters.

Responsive Design: The interface is built with Tailwind CSS to be fully responsive and user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.

# How to Use
This application is a single-file HTML document. To use it, simply follow these steps:

Download or clone the digital_admin_assistant.html file to your local machine.

Open the file directly in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

The search functionality is immediately available. Just type your query into the search bar, and the results will appear dynamically below.

# Technology
HTML: Provides the structure of the web page.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.

JavaScript: Powers the search logic and dynamic content rendering.

# Note: This is a prototype application. The knowledge base is currently a small, hard-coded array of mock data points for demonstration purposes. A full-scale version would require a more extensive database and a backend to manage the full content of the Establishment Code.
